# 229: Closing Channels

Use `close(channel)`.

Channels have one more return value that tells you whether they are closed or not.

```go
func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 5)
    done := make(chan bool)

    go func() {
        // endless loop
        for {
            j, more := <-jobs
            if more {
                // the channel isn't closed
                fmt.Println("working on job", j)
                // I think this is blocking, but the code is
                // demonstrating `more`, not concurrency
                time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
                fmt.Println("finished job", j)
            } else {
                // the channel is closed
                done <- true
                return
            }
        }
    }()

    for job := 1; job <= 5; job++ {
        jobs <- job
        fmt.Printf("sent job %d\n", job)
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
    }
    close(jobs)
    fmt.Println("finished sending jobs")

    <-done
    fmt.Println("done")
}
```

Output:

```text
sent job 1
working on job 1
sent job 2
sent job 3
finished job 1
working on job 2
sent job 4
sent job 5
finished job 2
working on job 3
finished sending jobs
finished job 3
working on job 4
finished job 4
working on job 5
finished job 5
done
```
