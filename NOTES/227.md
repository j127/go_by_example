## 227: Timeouts

Since `select` is blocking, you might want to time-out the `select` statement so the program doesn't hang forever if something goes wrong.

```go
c1 := make(chan string)

go func() {
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
    c1 <- "hello channel 1"
}()

// this blocks but times out if a message doesn't arrive
select {
case m1 := <-c1:
    fmt.Println("received", m1)
// the next line will run because the goroutine is going to take too long
case <-time.After(time.Second):
    fmt.Println("timed out")
}
fmt.Println("done")
```
