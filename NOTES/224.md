## 224: Channel Synchronization

Wait for a goroutine to finish.

```go
func worker(done chan bool) {
    fmt.Println("worker is running")
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    done <- true
}

done := make(chan bool, 1)
go worker(done)

// this is blocking until it receives a message
<- done
fmt.Println("it's done")
```
