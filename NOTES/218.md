## 218: Methods

```go
type Musician struct {
    name string
    instrument string
}

// `Musician` is a "receiver" here.
func (m Musician) Play() {
    fmt.Printf("%s is playing the %s\n", m.name, m.instrument)
}

scriabin := Musician{"Scriabin", "Piano"}
scriabin.Play() // "Scriabin is playing the Piano"
```

The receiver can be a value or a reference. It depends on whether you want the method to mutate the struct.
