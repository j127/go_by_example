# `go_by_example`

Finished the website on 2020-07-05. I started typing out all the code, but then realized that it was enough to read, explain, and take paper notes.

Some of the examples were attempts to implement the task from memory, so they might not match the website.

## Running Programs

```text
$ go run hello.go
